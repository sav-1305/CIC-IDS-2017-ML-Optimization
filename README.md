Improved version of the [CIC-IDS-2017 Dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html), developed to compensate for dataset creation errors identified in the original dataset pertaining to ground-truth labels, network flow identification, and configuration-dependent labelling. The improved version can be found [here](https://intrusion-detection.distrinet-research.be/CNS2022/).
